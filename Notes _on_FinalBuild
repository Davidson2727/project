The chain of events when the app starts from main:

main>TerminalGui>router>synthController>synthObject>default

at this point we are setting up a defaults synth object, I think we should just use
synthObject's init. Or is this the only way to have a global object?


also it seems like we are kicking off the app with a view. should we be using a controller instead?


to get the save function to work properly private members for the synthObject class denoted by
leading '__' need to be set to protected members with '_'. 
Since they are being accessed by other classes they should not all be private,
but should some of them be public?
