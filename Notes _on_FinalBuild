The chain of events when the app starts from main:

main>TerminalGui>router>synthController>synthObject>default

at this point we are setting up a defaults synth object, I think we should just use
synthObject's init. Or is this the only way to have a global object?


also it seems like we are kicking off the app with a view. should we be using a controller instead?
